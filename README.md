Slides from my CodeMash 2020 talk, API Design for ETL

This is a talk that I was blessed enough to be able to give before staying inside 24 hours a
day. Infinite thanks to the amazing folks at CodeMash, once again, for making it happen and
allowing me to give my first talk ever through what I can only recall as a complete 
fear-induced blackout.

The recording can be found [on Pluralsight for free](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/codemash-session-71)!
